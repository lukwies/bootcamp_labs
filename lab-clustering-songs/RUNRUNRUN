Good morning guys!

Very sorry to say, but I cannot be with you today :(
The surgery was yesterday evening and my wife and the baby must probably stay in hospital until sunday.
It seems that everything went well so far and I am very happy about that. But I have to keep things
up and running here, have to go to the hospital again and care for my older one..

I hope you still made some progress on the project yesterday, so here I want to explain how to run the
code I've written.

Ignacio said, it's possible to run the main.py file from a jupyter-notebook but I don't know how this
can be done. So maybe you can ask him helping you out...

I just can describe my approach:

1) Open a terminal
2) Go to the directory where the 'main.py' file is located (Using cd command). It's in my project folder within the 'src' directory.
3) Type 'python main.py' into your terminal and the song recommender should start

This should work in the git-bash on windows and in the common mac terminal.
I wish you all the best for the presentation and thanks for your sympathy!
