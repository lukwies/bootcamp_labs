In simple words, it's to understand whether a person is happy or unhappy in producing the piece of text. Why we (or rather, companies) care about sentiment in texts? It's because by understanding the sentiments in texts, we will be able to know if our customers are happy or unhappy about our products and services. If they are unhappy, the subsequent action is to figure out what have caused the unhappiness and make improvements.\n","\n","Basic sentiment analysis only understands the *positive* or *negative* (sometimes *neutral* too) polarities of the sentiment. More advanced sentiment analysis will also consider dimensions such as agreement, subjectivity, confidence, irony, and so on. In this challenge we will conduct the basic positive vs negative sentiment analysis based on real Twitter tweets.\n","\n","NLTK comes with a [sentiment analysis package](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.sentiment.html). This package is great for dummies to perform sentiment analysis because it requires only the textual data to make predictions. For example:\n","\n","```python\n","\u003e\u003e\u003e from nltk.sentiment.vader import SentimentIntensityAnalyzer\n","\u003e\u003e\u003e txt = \"Ironhack is a Global Tech School ranked num 2 worldwide. \n","\n","Our mission is to help people transform their careers and join a thriving community of tech professionals that love what they do.\"\n","\u003e\u003e\u003e analyzer = SentimentIntensityAnalyzer()\n","\u003e\u003e\u003e analyzer.polarity_scores(txt)\n","{'neg': 0.0, 'neu': 0.741, 'pos': 0.259, 'compound': 0.8442}\n","```\n","\n","In this challenge, however, you will not use NLTK's sentiment analysis package because in your Machine Learning training in the past 2 weeks you have learned how to make predictions more accurate than that. The [tweets data](https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140) we will be using today are already coded for the positive/negative sentiment. You will be able to use the Naïve Bayes classifier you learned in the lesson to predict the sentiment of tweets based on the labels."]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"OyeeL9FewVEK"},"source":["## Conducting Sentiment Analysis\n","\n","### Loading and Exploring Data\n","\n","The dataset we'll be using today is located on Kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/kazanova/sentiment140). Once you have downloaded and imported the dataset, it you will need to define the columns names: df.columns = ['target','id','date','flag','user','text']\n","\n","*Notes:* \n","\n","* The dataset is huuuuge (1.6m tweets). When you develop your data analysis codes, you can sample a subset of the data (e.g. 20k records) so that you will save a lot of time when you test your codes."]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":9,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1364,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669219107311,"user":{"displayName":"Lukas Wiese","userId":"00143429381539772872"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"L_TEC-DixWKd","outputId":"d0b6cdb9-0061-4cd9-8274-60c3f264eb58"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["[nltk_data] Downloading package wordnet to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package wordnet is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package omw-1.4 to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package omw-1.4 is already up-to-date!\n","[nltk_data] Downloading package stopwords to /root/nltk_data...\n","[nltk_data]   Package stopwords is already up-to-date!\n"]},{"data":{"text/plain":["True"]},"execution_count":9,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"}],"source":["import pandas as pd\n","import numpy as np\n","import nltk\n","from nltk.stem import PorterStemmer \n","from nltk.stem.snowball import SnowballStemmer\n","from nltk.stem import WordNetLemmatizer \n","from nltk.corpus import stopwords\n","\n","nltk.download('wordnet')\n","nltk.download('omw-1.4')\n","nltk.download('stopwords')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":10,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4119,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669219114373,"user":{"displayName":"Lukas Wiese","userId":"00143429381539772872"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"bM52N5Vh3x5q","outputId":"1602b8ec-a979-40a8-f5dd-635b934b22f1"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["Drive already mounted at /content/drive; to attempt to forcibly remount, call drive.mount(\"/content/drive\", force_remount=True).\n"]}],"source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":11,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":515},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":4778,"status":"ok","timestamp":1669219122122,"user":{"displayName":"Lukas Wiese","userId":"00143429381539772872"},"user_tz":-60},"id":"2N_HELVEwVEM","outputId":"bcc19236-6853-4702-e0f4-07dea76829ee"},"outputs":[{"name":"stderr","output_type":"stream","text":["/usr/local/lib/python3.7/dist-packages/IPython/core/interactiveshell.py:3326: FutureWarning: The error_bad_lines argument has been deprecated and will be removed in a future version.\n","\n","\n","  exec(code_obj, self.user_global_ns, self.user_ns)\n"]},{"data":{"text/html":["\n","  \u003cdiv id=\"df-cb71ac75-4b16-47cf-accf-fea9d8334acb\"\u003e\n","    \u003cdiv class=\"colab-df-container\"\u003e\n","      \u003cdiv\u003e\n","\u003cstyle scoped\u003e\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th:only-of-type {\n","        vertical-align: middle;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe tbody tr th {\n","        vertical-align: top;\n","    }\n","\n","    .dataframe thead th {\n","        text-align: right;\n","    }\n","\u003c/style\u003e\n","\u003ctable border=\"1\" class=\"dataframe\"\u003e\n","  \u003cthead\u003e\n","    \u003ctr style=\"text-align: right;\"\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etarget\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eid\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003edate\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003eflag\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003euser\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003etext\u003c/th\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","  \u003c/thead\u003e\n","  \u003ctbody\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e0\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1467810672\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eMon Apr 06 22:19:49 PDT 2009\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNO_QUERY\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003escotthamilton\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eis upset that he can't update his Facebook by ...\u003c/td\u003e\n","    \u003c/tr\u003e\n","    \u003ctr\u003e\n","      \u003cth\u003e1\u003c/th\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e0\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e1467810917\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eMon Apr 06 22:19:53 PDT 2009\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003eNO_QUERY\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003emattycus\u003c/td\u003e\n","      \u003ctd\u003e@Kenichan I dived many times for the ball.

The bag of words contains all the unique words in your whole text body (a.k.a. *corpus*) with the number of occurrence of each word. It will allow you to understand which words are the most important features across the whole corpus.\n","\n","Also, you can imagine you will have a massive set of words. The less important words (i.e. those of very low number of occurrence) do not contribute much to the sentiment. Therefore, you only need to use the most important words to build your feature set in the next step. In our case, we will use the top 5,000 words with the highest frequency to build the features.\n","\n","In the cell below, combine all the words in `text_processed` and calculate the frequency distribution of all words. A convenient library to calculate the term frequency distribution is NLTK's `FreqDist` class ([documentation](https://www.nltk.org/api/nltk.html#module-nltk.probability)).

Using the top 5,000 words, create a 2-dimensional matrix to record whether each of those words is contained in each document (tweet). Then you also have an output column to indicate whether the sentiment in each tweet is positive. For example, assuming your bag of words has 5 items (`['one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five']`) out of 4 documents (`['A', 'B', 'C', 'D']`), your feature set is essentially:\n","\n","| Doc | one | two | three | four | five | is_positive |\n","|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|\n","| A | True | False | False | True | False | True |\n","| B | False | False | False | True | True | False |\n","| C | False | True | False | False | False | True |\n","| D | True | False | False | False | True | False|\n","\n","However, because the `nltk.NaiveBayesClassifier.train` class we will use in the next step does not work with Pandas dataframe, the structure of your feature set should be converted to the Python list looking like below:\n","\n","```python\n","[\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': True,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': True,\n","\t\t'five': False\n","\t}, True),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': False,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': True,\n","\t\t'five': True\n","\t}, False),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': False,\n","\t\t'two': True,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': False,\n","\t\t'five': False\n","\t}, True),\n","\t({\n","\t\t'one': True,\n","\t\t'two': False,\n","\t\t'three': False,\n","\t\t'four': False,\n","\t\t'five': True\n","\t}, False)\n","]\n","```\n","\n","To help you in this step, watch the [following video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-vVskDsHcVc) to learn how to build the feature set with Python and NLTK.
