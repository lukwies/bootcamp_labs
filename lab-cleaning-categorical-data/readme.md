### Instructions

1. Import the necessary libraries if you are starting a new notebook.

2. Find  all of the categorical data.  Save it in a categorical_df variable.

3. Check for NaN values.

4. Check all unique values of columns.

5. Check dtypes. Do they all make sense as categorical data?

6. Does any column contain alpha and numeric data?  Decide how to clean it.

8. Compare policy_type and policy.  What information is contained in these columns.  Can you identify what is important?
